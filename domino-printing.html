		<h2>Domino Printing (Nov 2018 - Jan 2019)</h2>

		<p><b>MJML, Pardot, Markdown, Github, Shell Scripting, Email Templates</b></p>

		<p>	From late 2018 to present (January 2019), I was tasked with hand coding a number of email templates for Domino printing. These email templates ranged from standard marketing emails, to internal newsletters. </p>

		<p>Domino used an online email marketing automation tool called <b>Salesforce Pardot</b>.</p>

		<p>This tool allows you to take your HTML email templates, and set up editable 'regions' so that when Domino staff members want to create a new email campaign, they can use your HTML template and simply edit the content, without any coding knowledge required themselves.</p>

		<p>Early on in this process, I was hand coding the email templates using raw HTML. This was a bigger task than it sounds because creating HTML email templates that work correctly on email clients all the way back to Outlook 2007 (which was part of the brief), required a lot of special quirks within the code to make the templates as robust as possible.</p>

		<p>Domino wanted us to code quite a lot of templates on a regular basis, so eventually I considered we might need a change from the raw HTML approach.</p>

		<p>In order to help Domino Printing utilise a more productive workflow, I suggested to them that we adopt an email framework, such as <b>MJML</b> or <b>Foundation Emails (by Zurb)</b>.</p>

		<p>This had a number of benefits:</p>

		<p>1. Code would already be pre-tested to help support older email clients, which was important to Domino</p>

		<p>2. A framework would come with plenty of pre-existing documentation</p>

		<p>3. The code would be much more "portable" amoung various development teams that Domino decide to contract in future</p>

		<p>I spent a number of hours developing a demo template in both MJML and Foundation- and met with Domino to report my findings. Domino chose MJML, and I then went on to produce a number of templates using the MJML framework.</p>

		<p>Eventually, we were dealing with over 100 email templates. I then improved the workflow further by <b>hand coding a shell script</b>, which allowed us to quickly automate tasks and make updates across multiple email templates if required.</p>

		<p>I helped to set up the Domino emails github repo and <b>wrote github documentation</b> for developers and users on how to update and use templates, respectively.</p>
