		<!-- Legacy URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20170621104819/http://thedigitalawards.co/winners/cambridgeshire-2015/ -->
		<p><b>Main Achievement:</b> Lucy Cavendish College won 'Gold' in the 'School, Education or Charity' category for the <a href="img/lucycav-digital-award-2015.jpg" target="_blank">Cambridgeshire Digital Awards 2015</a></p>

		<p><b>Technologies Used:</b> Bootstrap 2, Expression Engine, SASS.</p>

		<p>I was tasked with building the Front End of the Lucy Cavendish website, and also with integrating the website into a Content Management System. In this case, we used Expression Engine.</p>
		<p>During the build of this project, I worked closely with the designer to achieve as close to “Pixel perfect” as we possibly could. The level of detail was very minute - I took several hundred screenshots of the website throughout the build, and zoomed in on the pixels, to line everything up perfectly! </p>
		<p>Many of the navigation elements and buttons and so on were meticulously checked to make sure the gaps between things were mathematically perfect.</p>
