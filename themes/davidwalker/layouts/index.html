			<h2>Building an accessible, content-focused web</h2>

			<p><b>I'm passionate about programming, because in a digital world, the ability to program becomes the ability to shape the world.</b></p>

			<p>My passion is building websites that focus on providing a high quality user experience. I firmly believe a website can be both stylish and also accessibility-friendly.</p>

			<p>All too often, websites today are a minefield of excessive advertising, popups, privacy concerns, clickbait, misinformation, distracting animations and poor usibility practices.</p>

			<p>I hope in my corner of the web to provide a space where the content I provide is not only useful but also competent and trustworthy. I value reliable content in readable fonts over sensationalism & chasing trends. I want to inject some empathy into our technology by making websites accessible to all. You will not be pestered by unexpected animations or adverts as you browse - I will endevor to keep the user experience on this website clean, simple and content-focused.</p>


<!-- 			<h3>Values:</h3>

			<p>Accessibility</p>
			<p>Simplicity</p>
			<p>Ease of use</p>
			<p>Performance</p>

			<h2>My Technical Expertise</h2>

			<p>I make websites - hand coded, from the ground up. <b>I never use off the shelf themes</b>. I'm passionate about working with colleagues and clients alike to brainstorm ideas for websites that value <b>accessibility</b>, <b>user experience</b>, <b>information architecture</b> and <b>data-driven performance</b>. I specialise in Front End Development, but also enjoy some aspects of Backend Development too.</p>

			<p>When it comes to development, I prefer to learn by removing abstractions and learning <b>native technologies</b> wherever possible so that I gain an appreciation of how things work "under the hood" rather than being too dependent upon ever changing frameworks or templating systems. I believe the best solutions to technical challenges are usually ones with simplicity as the end goal.</p>

			<p><b>The following tables provide an overview of some of my skills to date;</b></p>

<!-- 			<h2>Why is (insert framework here) missing?</h2>

			<p>There are a multitude of other skills web developers are encouraged to learn these days. In the Javascript realm you have React, Angular, Vue, Next and many more. On the server side there are endless Content Management Systems and a choice of languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, Haskell and so on.</p>

			<p>There is little doubt that these technologies have some incredible benefits and I do not rule out learning more about any of them. However, with only so many hours in the day- developers must make an educated decision about how to invest their time and energy.</p>

			<p>One such way to gauge which technologies to learn is to look at what is popular. Technology Blogs, forums and online developer course schools create a lot of buzz surrounding certain trending frameworks or languages, but could it be that this can sometimes create  misleading perceptions about what technologies are <i>actually used in the real world</i>?</p>

			<p>According to data compiled from w3techs.com (as of January 2021) of the websites it monitors, the following technologies are used very frequently:</p>


			<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" bordercolor="#ececec"> 
				<tr bgcolor="#eee">
					<th align="left" width="200">Technology</th>
					<th align="left">% of websites that use</th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td valign="top" width="150px">Wordpress</td>
					<td valign="top">39.6%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top" width="150px">PHP</td>
					<td valign="top">79.1%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top" width="150px">Javascript</td>
					<td valign="top">97.1%</td>
				</tr>		
			</table>

			<p>Meanwhile, perhaps surprisingly given their popularity on tech blog and forums, the following is the usage %:</p>

			<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" bordercolor="#ececec"> 
				<tr bgcolor="#eee">
					<th align="left" width="200">Technology</th>
					<th align="left">% of websites that use</th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td valign="top" width="150px">React</td>
					<td valign="top">0.4%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top" width="150px">Ruby</td>
					<td valign="top">4.3%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top" width="150px">Python</td>
					<td valign="top">1.4%</td>
				</tr>		
			</table>

			<p>I have an enormous passion for learning and will absolutely continue to learn trending technologies, however my primary tech stack has been adopted for pragmatic purposes above all else - I want to be skilled in the technologies that have wide adoption rates and then add niche technologies to my stack as a complementary feature where possible.</p> -->
