				<h1>Creative Front-End Web Developer</h1>
				<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; Welcome to my corner of the web â€” I am a Front End Web Developer with a particular interest in vanilla Javascript and Accessibility. I am currently based in Cambridge, UK.</p>

				<h2>I build websites with a focus on Accessibility & Simplicity</h2>

				<p>I have over 10 years of industry experience building professional, responsive websites for a wide range of sectors including start-ups, education, conservation, biotech and non-profit industries. Some of the websites I have worked on have gone on to win awards.</p>

				<p>This site acts as a compendium of my articles & case studies on programming & technology - a collection of projects where I have acted as lead Front End Developer and a showcase of my skills.</p>

				<p>This particular website has been hand crafted from the ground up by me, using no third party frameworks.</p>

				<p><a href="tech-skills.html" class="button">Nice to meet you</a></p>

				<h2>Index of Contents</h2>

				<p>What's here? This is a quick overview of the pages you will find on this website. I know not many websites have the novel idea of actually using an index page as an index anymore, but given that I grew up seeing the web evolve, I wanted to sneak in a reference to <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">the world's first ever website</a> somewhere on my portfolio!</p>

						<h3><a href="tech-skills.html">Technical Skills</a></h3> 

							<p>An introduction to the skills I have aquired over the years as a Front End Web Developer. There's a lot to learn in the web development field, but sometimes it's easy to suffer from 'information overload'. It was a useful exercise for me to refelect back on just how far I've come.</p>

						<h3><a href="articles.html">Articles & Essays</a></h3> 

						<p>I would not call this section a blog, but rather a collection of essays which I've written over time on a diverse range of topics pertaining to development. I periodically update some of the existing articles and refine them as new information comes to me.</p>

						<h3><a href="case-studies.html">Project Case Studies</a></h3>

						<p>This is an ongoing collection of projects where I have acted as the primary web developer to showcase work I have done. I do not take any responsibility for the design or content or copyright of these external websites, they are simply to showcase my front-end coding ability.</p>
