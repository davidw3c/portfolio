				<h1>David Walker's Portfolio</h1>
				<p>Hello, and welcome to my corner of the web â€” I am a Front End Web Developer and Accessibility enthusiast who specialises in vanilla Javascript development and PHP based CMS integration based in Cambridge, UK.</p>

			<p>I have over 10 years of industry experience building professional, responsive websites for a wide range of sectors including start-ups, education, conservation, biotech and non-profit. Some of the websites I have worked on have gone on to win awards.</p>

			<p>This site acts as a compendium of my articles & case studies on programming & technology.</p>

			<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
			
			<p>I consider myself to be a digital minimalist - I think that too much of the internet has become bloated and confusing for users. A website should first and foremost present information in a way that is accessible to all. Pages should load quickly. The user experience should not be undermined by Javascript that hijacks a users ability to control the page or excessive distracting animations.</p>

			<p>From a code perspective, I try to code a project in such a way that if another developer were to come along and take over the project in future, they would understand how it works. This often means avoiding trying to look clever by making things overly complex, or adopting cutting edge technology for the sake of doing so. I would much prefer to create a project that uses some native technologies and assemble them in a way that other developers could easily understand (including myself when I revisit the project in future!). I like projects that are simple and stand the test of time, rather than complex and fad-driven.</p>

			<h2>Index of Contents</h2>

			<p>What's here? This is a quick overview of the pages you will find on this website.</p>

			<p><b><a href="tech-skills.html">Introduction & Technical Skills</a></b> : An introduction to the skills I have aquired over the years as a Front End Web Developer. There's a lot to learn in the web development field, but sometimes it's easy to suffer from 'information overload'. It was a useful exercise for me to refelect back on just how far I've come.</p>

			<p><b><a href="articles.html">Articles & Essays</a></b> : I would not call this section a blog, but rather a collection of essays which I've written over time on a diverse range of topics pertaining to development. I periodically update some of the existing articles and refine them as new information comes to me.</p>

			<p><b><a href="case-studies.html">Project Case Studies</a></b> : This is an ongoing collection of projects where I have acted as the primary web developer to showcase work I have done. I do not take any responsibility for the design or content or copyright of these external websites, they are simply to showcase my front-end coding ability.</p>
