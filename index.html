				<h1>David Walker's Web Development Portfolio</h1>
				<p>Hello, and welcome to my corner of the web â€” I am a Front End Web Developer and Accessibility enthusiast who specialises in vanilla Javascript development and PHP based CMS integration based in Cambridge, UK.</p>

			<h2>I build websites with a focus on accessibility & simplicity</h2>
			<p>I have over 10 years of industry experience building professional, responsive websites for a wide range of sectors including start-ups, education, conservation, biotech and non-profit. Some of the websites I have worked on have gone on to win awards.</p>

			<p>This site acts as a compendium of my articles & case studies on programming & technology.</p>

			<h2>Index of Contents</h2>

			<p>What's here? This is a quick overview of the pages you will find on this website. I know not many websites have the novel idea of actually using an index page as an index anymore, but given that I grew up seeing the web evolve, I wanted to sneak in a reference to <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">the world's first ever website</a> somewhere on my portfolio!</p>

			<ul class="indexOfContents">
			<li><b><a href="tech-skills.html">Introduction & Technical Skills</a></b> : An introduction to the skills I have aquired over the years as a Front End Web Developer. There's a lot to learn in the web development field, but sometimes it's easy to suffer from 'information overload'. It was a useful exercise for me to refelect back on just how far I've come.</li>

			<li><b><a href="articles.html">Articles & Essays</a></b> : I would not call this section a blog, but rather a collection of essays which I've written over time on a diverse range of topics pertaining to development. I periodically update some of the existing articles and refine them as new information comes to me.</li>

			<li><b><a href="case-studies.html">Project Case Studies</a></b> : This is an ongoing collection of projects where I have acted as the primary web developer to showcase work I have done. I do not take any responsibility for the design or content or copyright of these external websites, they are simply to showcase my front-end coding ability.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Elsewhere on the web</h2>

			<p>Here you can find some links to other places you can find me on the web.</p>

			<ul class="indexOfContents">
				<li><b><a href="https://codepen.io/davidatchameleon/" target="_blank">Codepen</a></b> : Check out some of my code snippets & experiments on codepen.io/davidatchameleon (opens in new window).</li>
