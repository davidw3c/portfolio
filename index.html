	<h1>Front End Developer. Javascript Fanatic. Accessibility Nerd.</h1>	

	<p>Hello üëã, I‚Äôm David ‚Äî a Front End Web Developer and Tech enthusiast who specialises in Javascript development based in Cambridge, UK. I have over 10 years of industry experience building professional, responsive websites for a wide range of sectors including start-ups, education, conservation, biotech and non-profit. Some of the websites I have worked on have gone on to win awards.</p>

	<p>I began my career over a decade ago by completing an OCN Level 3 Web Development course, and volunteering at a local web development agency. From there I got my first job as a junior developer and progressed on to work for an agency in Cambridge to become lead Front End Developer.</p>

	<p>I love what I do. In a world that has become increasingly digital, having coding skills gives me the ability to shape the world, and I always strive to put accessibility and high-quality user experience at the heart of projects that I work on. I enjoy the continuous learning experience as well as embracing the role of "creative problem solver"- taking complex challenges and turning them into simple, elegant solutions.</p>

	<p>Check out some of my code snippets & experiments on <a href="https://codepen.io/davidatchameleon/" target="_blank">Codepen</a> <img height="16" width="16" src="img/codepen.png"></p>

	<p><b>HTML:</b> Using the beautiful Sublime Text code editor, I write clean, effective and readable markup from the ground up using the BEM code architecture method. I include features such as ARIA roles for accessibility and keep all code neatly indented. I always aim where possible to keep markup 'humanly readable' and avoid bloat or ambiguity wherever possible.</p>

	<p><b>CSS & SASS:</b> Over the years I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of designs and layouts and have a very confident command of CSS. Whether it's building the responsive website structure using flexbox, CSS grid, or frameworks, creating mixins, variables, print style sheets or adding stylish animations, I enjoy bringing designs to life and striving for "pixel perfect" attention to detail.</p>

	<p><b>Javascript & AJAX:</b> With so many Javascript frameworks to choose from, I set myself a goal 3 years ago to learn as much vanilla Javascript as possible. My theory is that while frameworks come and go, the core language itself endures throughout time. Whilst I would not say I am a 'Javascript Jedi', I'm by no means a beginner either- I can comfortable write Javascript including traversing the DOM, for loops, Event bubbling, Adding / Removing class based upon scroll position, Adding and removing cookies, changing HTML attributes, Change content based upon date/time, Toggles (e.g. Mobile Menu Toggle), arrays, functions, name spacing, event listeners, form control, and much more. I have experimented with writing games such as Space Invaders using raw Javascript. I'm continually learning new things and it is my goal to continue to expand and grow in this area.</p>

	<p><b>SVG's:</b> I have experience of directly manipulating inline SVG's to animate them on a page.</p>

	<p><b>Task Runners (e.g. Gulp):</b> When I write HTML, SASS and Javascript- I use a task runner- in my case 'Gulp' - to watch and compile the code. I also install a plugin in my browser called "Live Reload" which allows me to see my changes happen live in the browser as it automatically refreshes each time I make a code update.</p>

	<p><b>GIT Version Control:</b> From local to staging to production. Using GIT to administer version control of projects. Experience of using Springloops and Buddy.</p>

	<p><b>Terminal:</b> Commands to push / pull / commit changes, resolve conflicts and merge changes, create new branches, switch branch etc.</p>

	<p><b>CMS Integration:</b> Wordress, Expression Engine, Craft CMS. I custom code templates to create themes using PHP, Twig or ExpressionEngine syntax. In the case of Wordpress, which I use most commonly, I tend to work with Advanced Custom Fields. I always aim to build a CMS setup that is tailored to a specific client and is as user friendly as possible.</p>

	<p><b>Accessibiliy:</b> A11y practices, page landmarks, keyboard friendly site navigations, contrast ratios, Progressive Enhancement build philosophy.</p>

	<p><b>Testing & Optimising:</b> Before ‚Äúgo live‚Äù I follow a process of looking at things such as Image optimisation, caching and use of tools such as Google Page Speed Insights to improve page loading times. I also ensure the groundwork for good SEO has been laid.</p>

	<p><b>Email Marketing Campaigns:</b> MJML, Foundation, Pardot, Mailchimp, Litmus testing</p>

	<p><b>Static Site Generators:</b> I have experience with two static site generators - Jekyll and HUGO (which powers this website). There are an endless list of static site generators to use, but I have found these two in particular to be very versatile.</p>

	<p><b>Setting websites live:</b> Using services such as TSO Host, Digital Ocean, GoDaddy and HostGator, editing hosts file via Terminal, creating Databases, importing databases, implimenting 'go live' checklists, pulling changes to live websites using GIT.</p>

	<p><b>Operating Systems:</b> Mac OS (work), Linux Ubuntu (personal), Linux Mint, Windows 7/10.</p>

	<p><b>Sublime Text Snippets:</b> I have written 'snippets' in sublime text which enable you to create a shortcut code, press tab and generate a ready to use code snippet.</p>

	<p><b>Shell Scripting:</b> I have written a number of BASH scripts for projects which incorporate Linux utilities such as Rsync, Sed, Grep, Head, Tail, PdfImages, ImageMagick to help drastically increase the speed of lengthy tasks and develop a system of efficient task automation.</p>

	<p><b>Video & Audio:</b> As a personal hobby I have experience with converting old analog video formats such as VHS tapes and 8mm video to digitised formats using hardware such as AV to HDMI converters &amp; upscalers, video capture devices and software such as virtualdub, OBS, winDV and others. I have a working knowledge of the various correct resolutions for capturing footage depending on the source (e.g. PAL vs NTSC), as well as deinterlacing, compression algorithms. I have also had experience of using Audacity to convert mono sound into stereo sound.</p>

	<p>Occasionally as I explore development topics, I like to write an article, partly as a reminder to myself on how to do certain things, and partly to help others.</p>	

	<h3><a href="interactive-google-maps-tutorial.html">Interactive Google Maps Tutorial</a></h3>

	<p>In this tutorial, I will walk through how to set up a map with multiple markers using the Google Maps API,  make it editable in Wordpress using the Advanced Custom Fields repeater field and additionally to categorise groups of map markers so that they can be filtered using onclick buttons in Javascript.</p>

	<h3><a href="sublime-snippets.html">Create code snippets in Sublime Text 3 </a></h3>
	<p>Code snippets in Sublime Text 3 can save you a lot of time. They allow you to create a key word which you type and then press ‚Äòtab‚Äô to generate a code block.</p>

	<h3><a href="pandoc-tutorial.html">Pandoc Tutorial: How to Create Pandoc Templates</a></h3>
	<p>Pandoc is a powerful tool that lets you convert one document type into another. It also has the ability to reference a template when converting multiple files.</p>

	<h3><a href="pardot-mjml-tutorial.html">Creating Pardot Email Templates using MJML</a></h3>
	<p>Creating an email template that works across multiple email clients can be a notoriously difficult task. However, templating tools such as MJML can make things much easier, and combining MJML with Pardot is a robust workflow to create effective email marketing campaigns.</p>

	<h3><a href="bulk-clone-with-rsync.html">How to bulk clone folders using rsync </a></h3>
	<p>One of the best features of a computer is the ability to automate tasks so that you don‚Äôt have to repeat the same task manually over and over. One such task you may face is copying files across multiple folders from one location to another.</p>

	<h3><a href="find-replace-words-perl-script.html">Find & replace words using a Perl script</a></h3>
	<p>Are you looking for a quick, powerful way to find and replace a word across multiple documents? Writing a small Perl script is a simple and powerful method you could try.</p>

	<h3><a href="wp-user-permissions.html">Create a Wordpress User role that only has access to a specific custom post type</a></h3>
	<p>There are already some default User Roles that can be used in Wordpress such as Editor, and Author. However, Custom User Roles can be useful to create in Wordpress if you want a finer level of control over the permissions.</p>

	<p>Presented here are a collection of projects where I have acted as the lead Front End Developer. Some projects are active and live, whereas other projects are simply write-ups and references to websites I worked on in the past. I take no responsibility for the content or design of these websites.</p>

	<h3>The Ogden Trust (2021-2022)</h3>

	<div class="iframe">
		<iframe src="ogden-home.html" height="410px" width="710px" title="description" name="ogden-frame"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>A central theme of the new Ogden Trust website has been to achieve good Accessibility. To meet this aim, The Ogden Trust hired the RNIB to produce reports throughout the build. showing how we could create the most accessible website possible.</p>

	<p>These reports highlighted a number of improvements I made, including responsive & clearly labelled data tables, use of accessibility friendly labels on forms and buttons, correct alt tag descriptions on images, adding ARIA states and landmarks to the HTML, good colour contrast and many more.</p>

	<p>Throughout the build, I used the WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) by WebAIM in Google Chrome to catch as many accessibility issues as possible.</p>

	<p>We wanted the website to work for keyboard users & screen-readers as well as desktop & tablet users. So the aim was to make the links on the website accessible via the tab key with clear ‚Äòfocus‚Äô outline states. I built the website header navigation using hand-coded javascript, to enable keyboard users to tab through each link, then press the enter key to ‚Äòopen-close‚Äô submenu drop downs , as well as automatically close the submenu when tabbing onto the next menu item.</p>

	<p>I turned the Ogden Trust designs into a fully functioning website with the aid of a Chrome plugin called ‚ÄòPerfect Pixel‚Äô. This plugin is the digital equivalent of tracing paper- allowing you to overlay a reduced opacity JPG image of the design onto the website and tweak the padding, margins and fonts until everything is perfectly lined up.</p>

	
	<h3>Westcott House (2020)</h3>

<div class="iframe">
	<iframe src="westcott-home.html" height="410px" width="710px" title="description" name="ogden-frame"></iframe>
</div>

	<p>Working closely with our wonderful client Shelby, I built the entirety of the front end of the Westcott House website to be both stylish and user-friendly. We worked through page-by-page to ensure the clients requirements were met.</p>

	<p>The website was built using SCSS with flexbox for layout, vanilla Javascript and PHP for Wordpress.</p>

	<p>A number of animations feature on the website that I coded using Javascript. For example, the homepage slideshow features a ‚Äòslide timer‚Äô which I hand-coded, and many pages contain quotes which fade in, which uses some Javascript to detect when the quote element is visible on page scroll.</p>

	<p>With as much attention to detail as possible in the front end using SCSS, I also fully integrated the website into Wordpress with a custom-built ‚Äòpage builder‚Äô that utilises Advanced Custom Fields. This includes relationship pickers for related pages & footer quotes, sidebar featured images & quotes, repeater fields for download data tables. There are forms for example for the newsletter signup, as well as many different custom post groups.</p>

	<h3>UK Music (2019)</h3>

	<div class="iframe">
		<iframe src="ukm-home.html" height="410px" width="710px" title="description" name="ogden-frame"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>The UK Music website was built to be as accessible as possible. The raw HTML view includes a ‚Äòskip to content‚Äô link which is visually hidden instead of using ‚Äòdisplay:none‚Äô, and HTML sections with specific ID‚Äôs and headings. Body text contrast ratio achieves a AAA rating.</p>

	<p>Page landmarks have the correct ARIA roles assigned to them.</p>

	<p>You can use the keyboards tab key to browse through the website. The browser default ‚Äòoutline‚Äô has not been hidden using CSS. There is a Javascript powered accessible navigation whereby dropdown menus can be accessed via the tab key.</p>

	<p>Articles include the ability to upload audio transcripts of the article using a dedicated online text to voice MP3 service.</p>

	<p>Footer links give users the choice of whether to click on the mailto email link or whether to highlight the text without clicking a link.</p>



	<h3>Freman College (2017)</h3>

	<div class="iframe">
		<iframe src="freman-home.html" height="410px" width="710px" title="description" name="ogden-frame"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p><b>Technologies:</b> Craft CMS v2, Flexbox, CSS Animations</p>

	<p>In March 2017, I was tasked with building the brand new Freman College website. Following on from other successful projects such as Lucy Cavendish College, I have found over the years that education based websites have been some of my favourite projects to work on.</p>
	<p>With Freman College having a target audience of both parents and students, the approach I wanted to take was to build a website which portrayed a comfortable middle ground between "Robust" and "Progressive".¬†Therefore, I built the underlying website structure to be as robust and browser friendly as possible- but added a layer of interesting animations and effects on top of this which would be available to modern browsers.</p>
	<p>Specifically with regard to animations, I had the idea of a threefold effect on loading the homepage- of first fading in the homepage text and slideshow, and then a second or two later, sliding down the header, and sliding up a news carousel, in perfect sync.</p>
	<p>Of particular note on this project was the huge amount of time and attention to detail which went into the mobile responsive of the website. We checked analytics before building the website and found that a large proportion of visitors were using mobile devices. I therefore placed a lot of emphasis making sure mobile elements and text were small, condensed and considered. I wanted to make sure the mobile navigation contained the best of both worlds - you can access both top level pages, or click on down arrows to reveal child pages.</p>

	<p><b>Technologies Used:</b> Bootstrap 2, Expression Engine, SASS.</p>

	<p>I was tasked with building the Front End of the Lucy Cavendish website, and also with integrating the website into a Content Management System. In this case, we used Expression Engine.</p>
	<p>During the build of this project, I worked closely with the designer to achieve as close to ‚ÄúPixel perfect‚Äù as we possibly could. The level of detail was very minute - I took several hundred screenshots of the website throughout the build, and zoomed in on the pixels, to line everything up perfectly! </p>
	<p>Many of the navigation elements and buttons and so on were meticulously checked to make sure the gaps between things were mathematically perfect.</p>

<h2>BCR Architects</h2>

<p><b>Technologies:</b> Craft CMS v3, SVG Animation</p>

<p>The new BCR Infinity Architects website design aims to merge two brands into one to create a unified, clean and minimalist look, and focusses on presenting information about the company such as team members, news and showcasing a large number of projects which are filterable by Javascript powered toggles.</p>

<p>We integrated the new website into Craft CMS, which has proven repeatedly to be a favourite among many of our clients due to its clean and user friendly interface.</p>

<p>BCR Infinity Architects used an internal designer to create a compelling illustrated graphic for the new website homepage. The idea of the graphic was to act as a landscape representation of the different architectural projects BCR have worked on and also allow website users to interact and click on various buildings to take them to a case study profile.</p>

<p>As with any animated, interactive element we work on, Chameleon began with a detailed planning phase- to map out step by step what the animation needs to do when the website is loaded, what parts of the animated element are clickable, and which areas have ongoing animations.</p>

<p>We divided the homepage animation up into a series of layers- which would slide up and fade in on page load, and defined some clickable ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù.</p>

<p>Once the planning and discussion phase was completed, the illustration was neatly organised within illustrator- giving each layer a unique ID name, and removing any unnecessary ‚Äúbloat‚Äù - in order to ensure fast page loading speeds and smaller file sizes.</p>

<p>The first task with the animation was to get the layers in place and have them animated in- one at a time. CSS transforms and animations were used to transition each layer in one at a time, before adding in the graphical elements.</p>

<p>Using SVG shapes, the various central axis points and coordinates were then manually plotted, to then achieve ‚Äúto and from‚Äù animated elements. In our case- we added spinning wind turbines, moving cranes and a moving tractor- using the native SVG animate element.</p>

<p>Finally, various buildings were then linked to case studies, using XLINK inside the SVG.</p>

<h2>Queen's Foundation (2016)</h2>

<p>The Queens Foundation website was one of the first websites which I built using Craft- a Content Management System that we adopted due to it‚Äôs ease of use, security and better overall development experience.</p>

<p>And what a great project Queen‚Äôs proved to be. The client was a pleasure to work with- directly collaborating together to not only deliver the project on time, but create a piece of work we could all be proud of.</p>

<p>The Queen‚Äôs website has a lot of content, and as such makes use of many different content types - such as Accordions, Tabs, Tables and so on. Any website with a lot of content needs to rely upon an efficient, user friendly navigation structure and I believe Queen‚Äôs has this.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed working on Queen‚Äôs and it was great to see all our hard work payed off when the Client left us a 5 star review on Google.</p>

<h2>Woolf Institute, Cambridge</h2>

<p><b>Technologies:</b> Craft CMS v2, Coloured Sections, CSS Animations</p>
<p>The Woolf Institute approached Chameleon for a brand new website which would launch in conjunction with their move to an impressive new premises on Madingley Road in Cambridge.</p>
<p>On every project I work on, I usually try to set myself a challenge that aims to make the website I am building unique.</p>
<p>In the case of Woolf, I made the focus very much upon bringing the website to life with movements and animations.</p> 
<p>I came up with a number of ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The book logo pages light up when hovering over the logo in the header and also reveal when reaching the footer</li>
<li>Buttery smooth drop down menus</li>
<li>Social icons which progressively reveal from the side of the page</li>
<li>Homepage promo boxes which light up on page load</li>
<li>I also came up with the idea of geometric shapes rotating slowly on the Blog header area</li>
<li>On download pages, the icon animates to signify a download link</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the website is very colourful, with unique colours per section. </p>
<p>The Woolf Institute was a pleasure to build, and great clients to work with. At the end of the project, myself along with the Chameleon team were treated to a tour of their brand new building. </p>
