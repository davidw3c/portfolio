		<h2>The Queen's Foundation (2017)</h2>

		<p>The Queens Foundation website was one of the first websites which I built using Craft- a Content Management System that we adopted due to it’s ease of use, security and better overall development experience.</p>

		<p>And what a great project Queen’s proved to be. The client was a pleasure to work with- directly collaborating together to not only deliver the project on time, but create a piece of work we could all be proud of.</p>

		<p>The Queen’s website has a lot of content, and as such makes use of many different content types - such as Accordions, Tabs, Tables and so on. Any website with a lot of content needs to rely upon an efficient, user friendly navigation structure and I believe Queen’s has this.</p>

		<p>I really enjoyed working on Queen’s and it was great to see all our hard work payed off when the Client left us a 5 star review on Google:</p>

		<p>“(the)....team at Chameleon Studies are outstanding! From the off they have been creative, attentive, responsive, and a pleasure to work with. We are thrilled with the website and impressed with the level of care they provide in their ongoing support. We felt very looked after and recommend them wholeheartedly.”</p>
