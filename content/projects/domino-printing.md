From late 2018 to present (January 2019), I was tasked with hand coding a number of email templates for Domino printing. These email templates ranged from standard marketing emails, to internal newsletters.

Domino used an online email marketing automation tool called salesforce pardot.

I learned how to integrate email templates into pardot to create editable 'regions' and setup new campaigns.

During the process of hand coding email templates, I learned about the many quirks of older email clients (Outlook 2007!).

In order to help Domino Printing utilise a more productive workflow, I suggested to them that we adopt an email framework, such as MJML or Foundation Emails (by Zurb).

This had a number of benefits:

1. Code would be pre-tested to help support older email clients, which was important to Domino

2. A framework would come with plenty of pre-existing documentation

3. The code would be much more "portable" amoung various development teams that Domino decide to contract in future

I spent a number of hours developing a demo template in both MJML and Foundation- and met with Domino to report my findings. Domino chose MJML, and I am now in the process of building a number of "boilerplate" email templates, which will help Domino standardise their email marketing strategy moving forwards.
