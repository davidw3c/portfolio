The Woolf Institute approached Chameleon for a brand new website which would launch in conjunction with their move to an impressive new premises on Madingley Road in Cambridge.

On every project I work on, I usually try to set myself a challenge that aims to make the website I am building unique.

In the case of Woolf, I made the focus very much upon bringing the website to life with movements and animations.

## Ideas

I came up with a number of ideas:

- The book logo pages light up when hovering over the logo in the header and also reveal when reaching the footer
- Buttery smooth drop down menus
- Social icons which progressively reveal from the side of the page
- Homepage promo boxes which light up on page load
- I also came up with the idea of geometric shapes rotating slowly on the Blog header area
- On download pages, the icon animates to signify a download link 

In addition, the website is very colourful, with unique colours per section.

## Outcome

The Woolf Institute was a pleasure to build, and great clients to work with. At the end of the project, myself along with the Chameleon team were treated to a tour of their brand new building.
