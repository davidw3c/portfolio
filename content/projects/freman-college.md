In March 2017, I was tasked with building the brand new Freman College website. Following on from other successful projects such as Lucy Cavendish College, I have found over the years that education based websites have been some of my favourite projects to work on.

With Freman College having a target audience of both parents and students, the approach I wanted to take was to build a website which portrayed a comfortable middle ground between "Robust" and "Progressive". 
Therefore, I built the underlying website structure to be as robust and browser friendly as possible- but added a layer of interesting animations and effects on top of this which would be available to modern browsers.
Specifically with regard to animations, I had the idea of a threefold effect on loading the homepage- of first fading in the homepage text and slideshow, and then a second or two later, sliding down the header, and sliding up a news carousel, in perfect sync. 

Of particular note on this project was the huge amount of time and attention to detail which went into the mobile responsive of the website. We checked analytics before building the website and found that a large proportion of visitors were using mobile devices. I therefore placed a lot of emphasis making sure mobile elements and text were small, condensed and considered. I wanted to make sure the mobile navigation contained the best of both worlds - you can access both top level pages, or click on down arrows to reveal child pages.
