In this article I would like to touch upon some of the negative effects of modern day technology and why a much older institution - the Library - may in fact be a perfect way to spend some time away from screens.

Books and libraries were the primary means through which people gathered information in the past before the arrival of the internet. In a relatively short period of time, the internet has come to totally dominate our society and while it provides a great many benefits to us, there is also growing awareness of many negative effects the internet may be having on our mental health & wellbeing.

If you are suffering from any of these negative effects, then it is wise to prioritise having some 'screen free' time. There are plenty of things you can do without being on a computer, but in this article I would like to present 7 reasons why a Library might be the ideal place to go.

## 1. Free of charge. 

Unlike the internet, the library doesn't need to cost you anything. You can access lots of information and read plenty of books about any subjects of your choosing, free of charge. 

Why is this important? In today's internet dominant society we're constantly being bombarded with advertising and consumerism (more on this later). The purpose of any advert is to convince you to part with your money for something which, in truth, you don't really need. There are many methods employed to convince us to do this, but many of them involve making us feel inadequate in some fashion - such as making us feel like we're not going to be socially accepted if we do not own the latest mobile phone or buy certain brands.

This surely cannot be healthy for us, and I think it's more important than ever before that we have an institution in our society that provides us with a safe haven away from all of this endless materialism and consumerism.

If you are trying to live a frugal lifestyle, trying to save a bit of money, or simply trying to limit exposure to "one click purchase" websites, the library is the place to be.

## 2. It's more sociable. 

Whether one is alone, or amoungst other people, browsing the internet tends to be a socially isolating activity. Whilst it is possible to browse the internet in the presence of other people, we often become so transfixed on screens or distracted by notifications that we tend to communicate less effectively with those around us. In most instances, people will browse the internet alone - and spend many hours in isolation staring at screens. Perhaps we may use social media websites or chat apps, but these merely provide a digital representation of social interaction as opposed to the real deal. There are so many elements to human interaction which the medium of technology simply cannot provide us with.

While PC's (or Personal Computers) were invisaged with individualism in mind, the Library was created as a public space in which all people could have access to information. Simply by being there, we are in the presence of real people with real analog objects such as books. This grounds us back in reality away from artifical digital represensations and we may in fact socialise with those around us but even if we do not, simply being in a public setting can effect behaviour in a positive way to what otherwise might be the case had one stayed at home.

## 3. Health & Exercise. 

To browse the internet we barely need to move - we reach for our smartphone or computer and tend to remain placid and idle throughout the hours we spend surfing the web. We may even have snacks nearby to eat throughout the day. A library on the other hand must be travelled to. Whichever way we choose to travel to the library, it will at least involve some movement and walking on our part - perhaps some fresh air and stretching your legs. Right away this is more healthy than staying hunched over a screen all day.

## 4. Ad-free & Private. 

On the internet we are bombarded with adverts all of the time. One pop up, banner or audio ad after another tries to steal our attention. Our activity surfing the web is constantly being tracked and this data used to target adverts towards us as well as companies selling on our data. At least in a Library, it's just you and the books - you can read in peace, without endlessly clicking to close intrusive and annoying advertisment popups.

## 5. Reliable information (no clickbait). 

When you surf many of the most popular websites such as Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and so on, you will typically be bombarded with lots of sensationalised, polarizing content. The aim in many instances is to cause a sense of outrage and grab your attention. This creates a very unhealthy view of the world and I believe is one of the things that is responsible for why our modern day society is so heavily divided. On the other hand, whilst books are by no means perfect and there are controversial books out there, in general you do at least stand a better chance of coming across information that has been legitimately published with the intention of providing knowledge on a certain subject. 

## 6. Delayed gratification. 

We can search on google for any question and instantly find "answers". These answers may not be correct, but they do provide a feeling of instant gratification. With books, you may have to make your way through many pages of many books to find what you are looking for - but this delayed gratification may actually be a good thing. For one, you're learning plenty of valuable information while you find what you are looking for, and secondly, once you do find what you are looking for it will be a much more rewarding experience.

## 7. Improves Focus & Attention span. 

Most of us have become accustomed to 'skim reading' on the internet. We open up multiple browser tabs, we jump from topic to topic, we search for terms which return thousands of results. This behaviour over time is acting to shorten our attention spans and make it harder for us to maintain focus. Books on the other hand help to heal the brain and restore the balance. We must reduce the pace, take things more slowly, and read from page to page, absorbing the information in a linear fashion. By limiting the amount of resources we make a conscious choice to seek informational quality over quantity. 


## Conclusion

The purpose of this article is not to suggest that the internet is all bad, or that libraries are superior to the internet in every way, but rather to suggest that sometimes in our fast paced modern way of life where we spend much of our lives on screens, it can help to consider what we did to gather information before the internet became so dominant, and consider some of the benefits of taking a break from our screens and relaxing with a good book in a local library.
