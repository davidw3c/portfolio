This page is still under construction, but I have a few plans for the near future:

## Coding 'Space Invaders' in Vanilla Javascript

My latest personal project, which is about halfway complete, I am coding the original 1970's arcade game 'Space invaders' from scratch in vanilla Javascript - using no tutorials. I plan to post a full write-up of the journey I went through in attempting to code this up.

## Accessibility features

I also plan to create an extensive range of content covering the topic of web accessibility. I am hoping in the near future to run this website through various accesibility checks and highlight the importance of building a web that is accessible for everyone.
