<h1>How I built this website</h1>

I wanted my personal website to pay subtle tributes to the history of computing wherever possible. I grew up in the 90's and watched as the internet became mainstream. 

My homepage pays homage to the internet's first ever web page- by Tim Berners-Lee. I find it really interesting to go back to where it all started and see that his homepage, aka the index.html page, is literally an <i>index</i> - a list of pages you can find on the website. This is of course very different to what we are used to today with a menu bar at the top of each website. I wanted to take this approach and add something similar to my homepage, with a kind of "Index of contents" list of page links, with each individual page linking back to the Index and keeping the structure flat.
