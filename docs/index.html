			<h1 class="heading-title">Cambridge Web Developer</h1>

			<p>Hello, I’m David — a Front End Web Developer and Tech Enthusiast based in Cambridge, UK.</p>

			<p>I have over 8 years of industry experience building professional websites for a wide range of sectors including start-ups, education, conservation, biotech and non-profit.</p>

			<h2>Beautiful websites, Coded beautifully</h2>
			<p>I make websites - hand coded, from the ground up. <b>I never use off the shelf themes</b>. I'm passionate about working with colleagues and clients alike to brainstorm ideas for websites that value <b>accessibility</b>, <b>user experience</b>, <b>information architecture</b> and <b>data-driven performance</b>. I specialise in Front End Development, but also enjoy some aspects of Backend Development too.</p>

			<p>When it comes to development, I prefer to learn by removing abstractions and learning <b>native technologies</b> wherever possible so that I gain an appreciation of how things work "under the hood" rather than being too dependent upon ever changing frameworks or templating systems. I believe the best solutions to technical challenges are usually ones with simplicity as the end goal.</p>

			<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>

In the past, Whilst in the past I have used frameworks such as Bootstrap, I have not used them for many years now as I prefer to hand-code projects using techniques such as Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS Variables, Calc functions and many more.</p></td>

I have a working knowledge of the various correct resolutions for capturing footage depending on the source (e.g. PAL vs NTSC), as well as deinterlacing, compression algorithms and using Audacity to convert mono sound into stereo sound.</p></td>

			<h2>What about React, Angular, Python, Ruby ect?</h2>

			<p>There are a multitude of other skills web developers are encouraged to learn these days. In the Javascript realm you have React, Angular, Vue, Next and many more. On the server side there are endless Content Management Systems and a choice of languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, Haskell and so on.</p>

			<p>There is little doubt that these technologies have some incredible benefits and I do not rule out learning more about any of them. However, with only so many hours in the day- developers must make an educated decision about how to invest their time and energy.</p>

			<p>One such way to gauge which technologies to learn is to look at what is popular. Technology Blogs, forums and online developer course schools create a lot of buzz surrounding certain trending frameworks or languages, but could it be that this can sometimes create  misleading perceptions about what technologies are <i>actually used in the real world</i>?</p>

			<p>According to data compiled from w3techs.com (as of January 2021) of the websites it monitors:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Wordpress</b> is used on 39.5% of websites</li>
				<li><b>PHP</b> is used on 79.1% of websites</li>
				<li><b>Javascript</b> is used on 97.1% of websites</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Meanwhile, perhaps surprisingly given their popularity on tech blog and forums:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Vue JS</b> is used on 0.5% of websites</li>
				<li><b>Angular JS</b> is used on 0.4% of websites</li>
				<li><b>React JS</b> is used on 0.3% of websites</li>
				<li><b>Ruby</b> is the backend language of choice for 4.3% of websites</li>
				<li><b>Python</b> is the backend language of choice for 1.4% of websites</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I have an enormous passion for learning and will absolutely continue to learn trending technologies, however my primary tech stack has been adopted for pragmatic purposes above all else - I want to be skilled in the technologies that have wide adoption rates and then add niche technologies to my stack as a complementary feature where possible.</p>
