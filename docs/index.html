		<p>Hello, I’m David — a Front End Web Developer and Tech Enthusiast who specialises in Javascript development based in Cambridge, UK.</p>

		<p>I have over 9 years of industry experience building professional websites for a wide range of sectors including start-ups, education, conservation, biotech and non-profit.</p>

			<h2>Building an accessible, content-focused web</h2>

			<p><b>I'm passionate about programming, because in a digital world, the ability to program becomes the ability to shape the world.</b></p>

			<p>My passion is building websites that focus on providing a high quality user experience. I firmly believe a website can be both stylish and also accessibility-friendly.</p>

			<p>All too often, websites today are a minefield of excessive advertising, popups, privacy concerns, clickbait, misinformation, distracting animations and poor usibility practices.</p>

			<p>I hope in my corner of the web to provide a space where the content I provide is not only useful but also competent and trustworthy. I value reliable content in readable fonts over sensationalism & chasing trends. I want to inject some empathy into our technology by making websites accessible to all. You will not be pestered by unexpected animations or adverts as you browse - I will endevor to keep the user experience on this website clean, simple and content-focused.</p>

			<h2>My Technical Expertise</h2>

			<p>I make websites - hand coded, from the ground up. <b>I never use off the shelf themes</b>. I'm passionate about working with colleagues and clients alike to brainstorm ideas for websites that value <b>accessibility</b>, <b>user experience</b>, <b>information architecture</b> and <b>data-driven performance</b>. I specialise in Front End Development, but also enjoy some aspects of Backend Development too.</p>

			<p>When it comes to development, I prefer to learn by removing abstractions and learning <b>native technologies</b> wherever possible so that I gain an appreciation of how things work "under the hood" rather than being too dependent upon ever changing frameworks or templating systems. I believe the best solutions to technical challenges are usually ones with simplicity as the end goal.</p>

			<p><b>The following tables provide an overview of some of my skills to date;</b></p>
