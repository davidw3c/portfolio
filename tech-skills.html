				<h1>Introduction & Technical Skills</h1>
				<p>An introduction to the skills I have aquired over the years as a Front End Web Developer.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
		<p>I began my career over a decade ago by completing an OCN Level 3 Web Development course, and volunteering at a local web development agency. From there I got my first job as a junior developer and progressed on to work for an agency in Cambridge to become lead Front End Developer.</p>

		<p><b>HTML:</b> Using the beautiful Sublime Text code editor, I write clean, effective and readable markup from the ground up using the BEM code architecture method. I include features such as ARIA roles for accessibility and keep all code neatly indented. I always aim where possible to keep markup 'humanly readable' and avoid bloat or ambiguity wherever possible.</p>

		<p><b>CSS & SASS:</b> Over the years I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of designs and layouts and have a very confident command of CSS. Whether it's building the responsive website structure using flexbox, CSS grid, or frameworks, creating mixins, variables, print style sheets or adding stylish animations, I enjoy bringing designs to life and striving for "pixel perfect" attention to detail.</p>

		<p><b>Javascript & AJAX:</b> With so many Javascript frameworks to choose from, I have made it my priority to excel at vanilla Javascript. My theory is that while frameworks come and go, the core language itself endures throughout time and most of the time you can achieve in Vanilla JS quickly without the need for a whole framework. Whilst I would not say I am a 'Javascript Jedi', I'm by no means a beginner either- I can comfortable write Javascript including traversing the DOM, for loops, Event bubbling, Adding / Removing class based upon scroll position, Adding and removing cookies, changing HTML attributes, Change content based upon date/time, Toggles (e.g. Mobile Menu Toggle), arrays, functions, name spacing, event listeners, form control, and much more. I have experimented with writing games such as Space Invaders using raw Javascript. I'm continually learning new things and it is my goal to continue to expand and grow in this area.</p>

		<p><b>SVG's:</b> I have experience of directly manipulating inline SVG's to animate them on a page.</p>

		<p><b>Task Runners (e.g. Gulp):</b> When I write HTML, SASS and Javascript- I use a task runner- in my case 'Gulp' - to watch and compile the code. I also install a plugin in my browser called "Live Reload" which allows me to see my changes happen live in the browser as it automatically refreshes each time I make a code update.</p>

		<p><b>GIT Version Control:</b> From local to staging to production. Using GIT to administer version control of projects. Experience of using Springloops and Buddy.</p>

		<p><b>Terminal:</b> Commands to push / pull / commit changes, resolve conflicts and merge changes, create new branches, switch branch etc.</p>

		<p><b>CMS Integration:</b> Wordress, Expression Engine, Craft CMS. I custom code templates to create themes using PHP, Twig or ExpressionEngine syntax. In the case of Wordpress, which I use most commonly, I tend to work with Advanced Custom Fields. I always aim to build a CMS setup that is tailored to a specific client and is as user friendly as possible.</p>

		<p><b>Accessibiliy:</b> A11y practices, page landmarks, keyboard friendly site navigations, contrast ratios, Progressive Enhancement build philosophy.</p>

		<p><b>Testing & Optimising:</b> Before “go live” I follow a process of looking at things such as Image optimisation, caching and use of tools such as Google Page Speed Insights to improve page loading times. I also ensure the groundwork for good SEO has been laid.</p>

		<p><b>Email Marketing Campaigns:</b> MJML, Foundation, Pardot, Mailchimp, Litmus testing</p>

		<p><b>Static Site Generators:</b> I have experience with two static site generators - Jekyll and HUGO (which powers this website). There are an endless list of static site generators to use, but I have found these two in particular to be very versatile.</p>

		<p><b>Setting websites live:</b> Using services such as TSO Host, Digital Ocean, GoDaddy and HostGator, editing hosts file via Terminal, creating Databases, importing databases, implimenting 'go live' checklists, pulling changes to live websites using GIT.</p>

		<p><b>Operating Systems:</b> Mac OS (work), Linux Ubuntu (personal), Linux Mint, Windows 7/10.</p>

		<p><b>Sublime Text Snippets:</b> I have written 'snippets' in sublime text which enable you to create a shortcut code, press tab and generate a ready to use code snippet.</p>

		<p><b>Shell Scripting:</b> I have written a number of BASH scripts for projects which incorporate Linux utilities such as Rsync, Sed, Grep, Head, Tail, PdfImages, ImageMagick to help drastically increase the speed of lengthy tasks and develop a system of efficient task automation.</p>

		<p><b>Video & Audio:</b> As a personal hobby I have experience with converting old analog video formats such as VHS tapes and 8mm video to digitised formats using hardware such as AV to HDMI converters &amp; upscalers, video capture devices and software such as virtualdub, OBS, winDV and others. I have a working knowledge of the various correct resolutions for capturing footage depending on the source (e.g. PAL vs NTSC), as well as deinterlacing, compression algorithms. I have also had experience of using Audacity to convert mono sound into stereo sound.</p>
